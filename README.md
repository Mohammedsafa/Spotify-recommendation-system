# Dance-Themed Playlist for Summer Party

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
The goal of this analysis is to create a dance-themed playlist for the company's summer party using data-driven insights. The playlist will be curated based on the 'danceability' feature of the songs, which is available in the Spotify dataset. The analysis will involve the following steps:

- Exploratory Data Analysis: Use descriptive statistics and data visualization techniques to understand the distribution of â€˜danceabilityâ€™ and its relationship with other audio features in the dataset. Based on our analysis, we have identified the following criteria for song selection:
    1. Danceability: Select songs with a danceability score higher than 0.626, which corresponds to the upper 40% of the data.
    2. Popularity: Choose songs with a popularity score higher than 50, which corresponds to the upper 25% of the data.
    3. Energy: Include songs with an energy score higher than 0.68, which corresponds to the median value.
    4. Valence: Select songs with a valence score higher than 0.549, which corresponds to the upper 40% of the data.

- Predictive Modeling: Develop a machine learning model that predicts a songâ€™s â€˜danceabilityâ€™ based on its audio features. This will involve preparing the data, selecting a model, training the model, and evaluating its performance.

- Playlist Creation: Apply the predictive model to the Spotify dataset to score each song by its predicted â€˜danceabilityâ€™. The top 50 songs according to these scores will be selected for the dance party playlist.

The ultimate goal is to leverage data analysis and machine learning techniques to make informed decisions about song selection, ensuring that the playlist sets the right mood for a fun and energetic summer party.
